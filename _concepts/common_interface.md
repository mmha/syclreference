Most classes in SYCL fall into two categories: The ones following the common reference semantics, and those that follow the common value semantics.

# OpenCL Wrappers
_Classes: `platform`, `device`, `context`, `queue`, `program`, `kernel`, `event`, `buffer`, `image`, `sampler`, `stream`_

# Reference Semantics

# Value Semantics
